# Idle Recovery Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the improvements made to handle frontend connection recovery after idle periods.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Poor Idle Recovery

- **Problem**: Frontend didn't recover gracefully after being idle for a minute or so
- **Root Cause**: Limited connection state tracking and no proactive reconnection on tab visibility changes

### 2. Missing Connection Feedback

- **Problem**: Users had no visual indication when connection was lost or reconnecting
- **Root Cause**: No UI component to display connection status

## Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Connection Management (`src/cloudflare-client.ts`)

#### Comprehensive Event Handling

- **Page Visibility**: Detects when tab becomes hidden/visible (`visibilitychange`)
- **Page Navigation**: Handles back-forward cache (`pagehide`/`pageshow`)
- **Window Focus**: Responds to window focus/blur events
- **Network Status**: Handles online/offline events

#### Heartbeat Mechanism

- **Ping/Pong**: Sends periodic pings (every 30 seconds) to test connection health
- **Latency Tracking**: Measures and reports connection latency
- **Smart Timing**: Only sends pings when tab is visible to conserve resources

#### Intelligent Reconnection

- **Proactive Checks**: Tests connection health when tab becomes active
- **Exponential Backoff**: Uses increasing delays between reconnection attempts
- **State Tracking**: Prevents multiple simultaneous reconnection attempts
- **Timeout Handling**: Sets timeouts for reconnection attempts

#### Connection State Management

- **Status Tracking**: Tracks connection state (`connected`, `disconnected`, `reconnecting`, `failed`, `offline`, `error`)
- **Event Emission**: Emits connection status events for UI feedback
- **Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of timers and event listeners

### 2. Visual Connection Status (`src/components/ConnectionStatus.tsx`)

#### Real-time Status Display

- **Visual Indicators**: Shows connection status with appropriate icons and colors
- **Status Messages**: Provides clear feedback about connection state
- **Auto-hide**: Automatically hides successful connection status after 3 seconds
- **Progress Indication**: Shows progress bar during reconnection attempts

#### Status Types

- **Connected**: Green with WiFi icon and latency display
- **Disconnected**: Orange warning with reconnection message
- **Reconnecting**: Blue info with spinning icon and progress bar
- **Failed**: Red error suggesting page refresh
- **Offline**: Red error indicating network issues
- **Error**: Red error for general connection problems

### 3. Backend Heartbeat Support (`workers/src/room-object.ts`)

#### Ping/Pong Handling

- **Ping Response**: Responds to client ping messages with pong
- **Timestamp Echo**: Returns client timestamp for latency calculation

## Usage

### For Users

1. **Visual Feedback**: Connection status appears in top-right corner when issues occur
2. **Automatic Recovery**: Connection automatically recovers when tab becomes active
3. **Clear Messaging**: Status messages explain what's happening and what to do

### For Developers

1. **Event Listening**: Use `onConnectionStatus()` to listen for connection events
2. **Manual Cleanup**: Call `cleanup()` when component unmounts
3. **Status Monitoring**: Monitor connection health through emitted events

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. Tab Switching

1. Open the app and join a room
2. Switch to another tab for 1-2 minutes
3. Switch back - connection should automatically recover

### 2. Network Interruption

1. Open the app and join a room
2. Disconnect network/WiFi
3. Reconnect network - app should detect and reconnect

### 3. Browser Minimization

1. Open the app and join a room
2. Minimize browser for 1-2 minutes
3. Restore browser - connection should recover

### 4. Sleep/Wake

1. Open the app and join a room
2. Put computer to sleep
3. Wake computer - connection should recover

## Configuration

### Timeouts and Intervals

- **Heartbeat Interval**: 30 seconds (when tab is visible)
- **Reconnection Timeout**: 10 seconds per attempt
- **Max Reconnection Attempts**: 5
- **Exponential Backoff**: Base delay of 1 second, doubled each attempt

### Customization

These values can be adjusted in the `CloudflareClient` class constructor:

```typescript
private maxReconnectAttempts = 5;
private reconnectDelay = 1000;
// Heartbeat interval in startHeartbeat() method: 30000ms
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: Seamless reconnection without manual intervention
2. **Better Reliability**: Proactive connection health monitoring
3. **Clear Communication**: Visual feedback about connection status
4. **Resource Efficiency**: Smart timing to avoid unnecessary network traffic
5. **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and recovery
